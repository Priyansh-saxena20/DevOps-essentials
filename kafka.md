#### Question:  What is Apache Kafka?
**Answer:** : Apache Kafka is a distributed, scalable, and fault-tolerant streaming platform designed to handle real-time data feeds. Developed by the Apache Software Foundation, Kafka is widely used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It provides a publish-subscribe messaging system, high-throughput, fault tolerance, and durability, making it suitable for various use cases such as log aggregation, event sourcing, and data integration.


#### Question:  Explain the role of Kafka in a distributed system.
**Answer:** : In a distributed system, Kafka serves as a distributed messaging system that enables communication and data exchange between different components or services. Its key roles include:
* Data Streaming: Kafka facilitates the streaming of real-time data between distributed components, allowing seamless communication in a decoupled manner.
* Event Sourcing: Kafka is often used for event sourcing architectures, where it serves as a reliable log to store and replay events.
* Scalability: Kafka's distributed nature allows it to scale horizontally, handling large volumes of data and providing fault tolerance.
* Integration: Kafka acts as a central hub for integrating diverse data sources and consumers within a distributed environment.


#### Question:  What is a topic in Kafka?
**Answer:** : In Kafka, a topic is a logical channel or category to which messages are published by producers and from which messages are consumed by consumers. Topics serve as the primary means of organizing and categorizing data within the Kafka cluster. Producers publish messages to specific topics, and consumers subscribe to topics to receive and process the messages. Topics enable the decoupling of data producers and consumers, allowing for flexible and scalable data processing.


#### Question:  Define a producer in Kafka.
**Answer:** : A producer in Kafka is a component or application responsible for publishing messages to Kafka topics. Producers create and send messages to specific topics, making the messages available for consumption by one or more consumers. Producers are typically designed to be highly scalable and fault-tolerant, ensuring reliable and efficient delivery of messages to Kafka brokers.


#### Question:  What is a consumer in Kafka?
**Answer:** : A consumer in Kafka is a component or application responsible for subscribing to and consuming messages from Kafka topics. Consumers process the messages produced by the producers. Kafka supports both parallel and distributed consumption, allowing multiple consumers to work together to process messages from a shared topic. Consumers can be part of a consumer group, providing scalability and fault tolerance.


#### Question:  Describe the purpose of a Kafka broker.
**Answer:** : A Kafka broker is a server instance within the Kafka cluster that stores and manages the distribution of messages. The primary purposes of a Kafka broker include:
* Message Storage: Brokers store the messages published by producers to topics. Messages are stored in partitions within the broker.
* Message Distribution: Brokers distribute messages to consumers based on the configured partitioning strategy, ensuring that each message is consumed by the intended consumer.
* Scalability: Kafka clusters consist of multiple brokers, allowing for horizontal scaling to handle increased message throughput and storage requirements.
* Fault Tolerance: Kafka brokers replicate data across the cluster to provide fault tolerance. If one broker fails, another can take over to ensure continuity.


#### Question:  How is data stored in Kafka?
**Answer:** : Data in Kafka is stored in the form of logs. Each topic is divided into partitions, and each partition is a linear, ordered sequence of messages. Messages within a partition are assigned a unique offset that represents their position in the partition. Kafka ensures durability by persisting messages to disk, making the data resilient to node failures. Additionally, Kafka allows for configurable retention policies, enabling the automatic deletion of older messages based on time or size constraints.


#### Question:  What is a Kafka record or message?
**Answer:** : In Kafka, a record or message is the basic unit of data that is produced and consumed. A record typically consists of two components:
* Key: An optional field that can be used for partitioning and indexing. The key is used to determine the partition to which the message will be sent.
* Value: The actual payload or data of the message. It contains the information that producers publish and consumers consume.<br>
Records are written to Kafka topics and are stored in partitions based on the specified partitioning strategy.


#### Question:  Explain the difference between a queue and a topic in Kafka.
**Answer:** : In Kafka, the terms "queue" and "topic" are often used interchangeably with "topic" being the more commonly used term. However, in the context of traditional messaging systems, the key differences are:
* Queue: In traditional messaging systems, a queue is typically associated with point-to-point communication. Each message is consumed by one consumer, and messages are typically removed from the queue once consumed.
* Topic: In Kafka, a topic is a more general concept representing a stream of records. Multiple consumers can subscribe to a topic, and messages are retained even after being consumed. This makes Kafka topics more suitable for publish-subscribe patterns.


#### Question:  What is the purpose of Kafka Zookeeper?
**Answer:** : Kafka relies on Apache ZooKeeper for distributed coordination and management of its cluster. The main purposes of Kafka ZooKeeper include:
* Cluster Coordination: ZooKeeper helps Kafka brokers coordinate and elect a leader for each partition, facilitating fault tolerance and load balancing.
* Metadata Storage: ZooKeeper stores and maintains metadata about Kafka brokers, topics, partitions, and consumer groups.
* Leader Election: ZooKeeper assists in the election of leaders for partitions, ensuring that each partition has an active leader broker.
* Configuration Management: ZooKeeper is used for managing and distributing configuration information across the Kafka cluster.<br>
ZooKeeper plays a critical role in the stability and coordination of the Kafka cluster, enabling it to function as a distributed and fault-tolerant system.


#### Question:  How does Kafka ensure fault tolerance?
**Answer:** : Kafka ensures fault tolerance through partition replication. Each partition has multiple replicas distributed across different brokers. If a broker fails, one of the replicas can be promoted to serve as the new leader, ensuring uninterrupted data availability. This replication strategy, combined with ZooKeeper for broker coordination and leader election, makes Kafka resilient to individual broker failures and contributes to the overall fault tolerance of the system.


#### Question:  Discuss the use of partitions in Kafka.
**Answer:** : Partitions are fundamental units of parallelism and scalability in Kafka. They allow Kafka to horizontally scale by distributing the data across multiple brokers. Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of messages, and topics are divided into partitions. Partitions enable parallel processing, as multiple consumers can simultaneously consume different partitions of a topic. The number of partitions also determines the parallelism and throughput of message processing within a Kafka cluster.


#### Question:  Explain the concept of replication in Kafka.
**Answer:** : Replication in Kafka involves creating redundant copies (replicas) of each partition across multiple brokers. This provides fault tolerance, ensuring that data remains available even if some brokers fail. Replicas include a leader and follower(s). The leader handles read and write operations, while followers replicate the data. If the leader fails, one of the followers is promoted to be the new leader. Replication factors are configurable, allowing users to balance fault tolerance with resource utilization.


#### Question:  What is the significance of the offset in Kafka?
**Answer:** : The offset is a unique identifier assigned to each message within a partition. It represents the position of a message in the partition's log. Consumers use offsets to keep track of the messages they have already consumed. Kafka ensures that each message has a unique offset within a partition, enabling consumers to resume processing from a specific point in the log. Offsets are stored in Kafka topics, providing a reliable way to maintain the state of message consumption.


#### Question:  How does Kafka handle message retention?
**Answer:** : Message retention in Kafka is managed through configurable retention policies. Kafka allows users to define retention based on time or size constraints. Messages that exceed the specified retention period or size are eligible for deletion. This feature ensures that Kafka does not indefinitely store all messages, helping manage storage costs and preventing the system from becoming overloaded with outdated data. Retention policies can be set at both the topic and broker levels.


#### Question:  What is a consumer group in Kafka?
**Answer:** : A consumer group in Kafka is a logical grouping of consumers that work together to consume messages from one or more topics. Each consumer group has one or more consumers, and each message within a topic partition is consumed by only one consumer within the group. Consumer groups enable parallel processing of messages, as different partitions can be consumed concurrently by different consumers. This architecture supports scalable and fault-tolerant message consumption.


#### Question:  Discuss the publish-subscribe model in Kafka.
**Answer:** : The publish-subscribe model in Kafka involves producers publishing messages to topics, and consumers subscribing to those topics to receive and process the messages. Multiple consumers can subscribe to the same topic, forming consumer groups. Each message is broadcast to all consumers within a group, allowing for parallel and distributed processing. This model enables decoupling between producers and consumers, supporting real-time data streaming and event-driven architectures.


#### Question:  Explain the process of Kafka producer acknowledgment.
**Answer:** : Kafka producer acknowledgment refers to the confirmation received by a producer after successfully publishing a message to a Kafka broker. Producers can configure the level of acknowledgment they require using the acks parameter:
* acks=0: No acknowledgment is requested. The producer assumes the message is sent successfully, but there is no confirmation.
* acks=1: The leader acknowledges the message once it is written to its local log. This provides a balance between performance and reliability.
* acks=all: The producer waits for acknowledgment from all in-sync replicas, ensuring the message is safely stored on multiple brokers for fault tolerance.<br>
Producers can choose the level of acknowledgment based on their requirements for durability and performance.


#### Question:  How does Kafka ensure data durability?
**Answer:** : Kafka ensures data durability through various mechanisms:
* Replication: Kafka replicates partitions across multiple brokers. This means that even if one or more brokers fail, data remains available from the replicas.
* Acknowledgment: Producers can configure acknowledgment settings (acks) to ensure that messages are safely written to Kafka brokers before considering them as successfully sent.
* Disk Persistence: Kafka persists messages to disk, ensuring that data is not lost in case of unexpected failures.<br>
These combined mechanisms contribute to the overall durability of data in Kafka.


#### Question:  What is the role of the Kafka Connect API?
**Answer:** : The Kafka Connect API is used for building and running connectors that integrate Kafka with external data sources or sinks. Connectors facilitate the movement of data in and out of Kafka, allowing seamless integration with databases, file systems, messaging systems, and other data storage or processing systems. Kafka Connect simplifies the development and deployment of data pipelines, enabling the transfer of data between Kafka topics and external systems in a scalable and fault-tolerant manner.


#### Question:  Discuss the importance of log compaction in Kafka.
**Answer:** : Log compaction is an important feature in Kafka that helps retain the latest value for each key in a log, while older values are periodically compacted and removed. This is particularly useful in scenarios where it is essential to maintain the latest state of each record, such as maintaining the current state of a database. Log compaction ensures that even if there are multiple writes for the same key, only the latest value is retained, reducing storage overhead and improving query efficiency.


#### Question:  Explain the role of the Kafka Schema Registry.
**Answer:** : The Kafka Schema Registry is a centralized service that manages the schemas for messages produced and consumed in a Kafka environment. It ensures that producers and consumers agree on the structure of the data by enforcing schema compatibility. This is crucial in evolving systems where data formats may change over time. The Schema Registry supports various serialization formats like Avro, JSON, and Protobuf. It plays a key role in maintaining compatibility and consistency in the data exchanged within a Kafka ecosystem.


#### Question:  What are Kafka Streams and its use cases?

#### Question:  What is the purpose of the Kafka Controller?
**Answer:** : The Kafka Controller is a crucial component within the Kafka cluster responsible for managing partitions, leaders, and replicas. Its main purposes include:
Partition Leader Election: The Controller ensures the election of a leader for each partition. The leader is responsible for handling read and write operations for that partition.
* Broker Health Monitoring: The Controller monitors the health of Kafka brokers, detecting broker failures or additions to the cluster.
* Reassignment of Partitions: In response to broker failures or additions, the Controller oversees the reassignment of partitions to maintain fault tolerance and load balancing.
* ISR (In-Sync Replicas) Management: The Controller manages the ISR list, ensuring that replicas are in sync and handling replicas that fall out of sync.


#### Question:  Discuss the significance of the ISR (In-Sync Replicas) list.
**Answer:** : The ISR (In-Sync Replicas) list is a subset of replicas for a partition that are considered in sync with the leader. The significance of the ISR list includes:
* Fault Tolerance: The ISR list ensures fault tolerance by only promoting replicas within the ISR list to leaders in case of a leader failure.
* Data Durability: Producers wait for acknowledgments from replicas in the ISR list before considering a write operation as successful, ensuring data durability.
* Consistent Replication: The ISR list ensures that replicas stay in sync with the leader, preventing data inconsistencies across replicas.
* Quorum-Based Decision Making: Kafka relies on a quorum of replicas in the ISR list to commit messages, providing a consistent and reliable way to handle writes.


#### Question:  How does Kafka handle message ordering within a partition?
**Answer:** : Kafka ensures strict ordering of messages within a partition. Each partition maintains a sequential log of messages, and each message is assigned a unique offset. Producers sequentially append messages to the end of the log, and consumers read messages in the order of their offsets. The ordering is guaranteed within a partition, but across partitions, there is no guaranteed global order. The combination of partitioning and offsets allows Kafka to maintain both the order of events and the ability to parallelize message processing.


#### Question:  Explain the role of the Kafka commit log.
**Answer:** : The Kafka commit log is the fundamental data structure that underlies the storage of messages in Kafka. It is a distributed, fault-tolerant, and durable log that records all messages published to Kafka topics. The commit log ensures the ordering, persistence, and fault tolerance of messages. Each partition has its own commit log, and messages are written sequentially to the log. Consumers read from the log, ensuring a consistent and ordered view of the data. The commit log is central to Kafka's design and enables its key features, such as fault tolerance and scalability.


#### Question:  Discuss the scenarios where Kafka is a better choice than traditional messaging systems.

#### Question:  How does Kafka handle backpressure?
**Answer:** : Kafka handles backpressure through its flow control mechanism. Consumers can control the rate at which they consume messages by adjusting parameters like max.poll.records and fetch.min.bytes. Producers, on the other hand, can use settings such as acks and linger.ms to control the rate at which they send messages. If a consumer is overwhelmed, it can reduce the frequency of poll requests or process messages more quickly. Similarly, producers can adjust their behavior to avoid overwhelming consumers. This dynamic adjustment allows Kafka to handle backpressure and maintain a balanced flow of data between producers and consumers.


#### Question:  Discuss the internal architecture of a Kafka broker.
**Answer:** : The internal architecture of a Kafka broker includes several components:

#### Question:  How does Kafka handle data compaction in detail?
**Answer:** : Kafka handles data compaction through a feature known as log compaction. Here's a detailed explanation:
* Log Segments: Kafka maintains data in log segments, each representing a sequential and immutable portion of a partition's commit log.
* Key-Value Pairs: Each message in Kafka is a key-value pair. The key is used for indexing and compaction purposes.
* Compact Policy: Log compaction is configured at the topic level using the cleanup.policy parameter. When set to compact, Kafka ensures that for each key, only the latest message (with the highest offset) is retained in the log.
* Deletes and Tombstones: If a key is marked for deletion, a special message known as a tombstone is appended to the log. During compaction, tombstones are retained, indicating that the key has been deleted.
* Retention Policy: The min.cleanable.dirty.ratio parameter defines the ratio of "dirty" (non-compacted) entries to "cleanable" entries. Once this ratio is exceeded, Kafka triggers compaction.
* Log Cleaner: The log cleaner is responsible for identifying and compacting log segments. It identifies obsolete or redundant messages and creates a new compacted segment with only the latest messages for each key.
* Compaction Process: During compaction, the log cleaner reads both active (non-compacted) and compacted segments, identifying and merging messages based on keys. Tombstones are used to mark deleted keys.<br>
Data compaction in Kafka ensures efficient use of storage by retaining only the latest version of each key, making it valuable for scenarios where retaining historical data is essential, but storage efficiency is critical.


#### Question:  Explain the scenarios where partitioning becomes a critical factor in Kafka.

Log appenders are integral to Kafka's write path, ensuring that log entries are efficiently and reliably appended to logs across the distributed Kafka cluster.


#### Question:  How does Kafka handle dynamic partition assignment in consumer groups?
**Answer:** : Kafka handles dynamic partition assignment in consumer groups through the following process:
* Group Coordinator: Each consumer group has a designated group coordinator responsible for managing group membership and partition assignments.
* Join Group Request: When a consumer joins a group or detects a change in the group, it sends a Join Group request to the group coordinator.
* Group Rebalance: The group coordinator initiates a group rebalance, which involves assigning partitions to consumers based on a selected assignment strategy.
* Assignment Strategy: Kafka supports multiple assignment strategies, such as Range or Round Robin, which determine how partitions are distributed among consumers during the rebalance.
* Assigned Partitions: After the rebalance, each consumer is assigned a subset of partitions, and the Kafka cluster updates the group metadata to reflect the new assignment.
* Heartbeats and Polling: Consumers regularly send heartbeats to the group coordinator to signal their liveliness. If a consumer fails to send heartbeats within a specified session timeout, it is considered inactive, and a rebalance is triggered.
* Dynamic partition assignment ensures that consumers within a group share the partition workload effectively, providing parallelism and fault tolerance.


#### Question:  Explain the impact of broker properties like min.insync.replicas on Kafka's reliability.
**Answer:** : The min.insync.replicas broker property in Kafka determines the minimum number of in-sync replicas (ISRs) required to acknowledge a write operation as successful. Its impact on Kafka's reliability includes:
* Durability: Setting min.insync.replicas to a value greater than 1 ensures that a write operation is only considered successful when the specified number of replicas, known as in-sync replicas, have acknowledged the write. This improves data durability by preventing acknowledgment until replicas are in sync.
* Fault Tolerance: min.insync.replicas contributes to fault tolerance by ensuring that a write operation is not acknowledged until a sufficient number of replicas are in sync. This protects against data loss in scenarios where some replicas may be unavailable or out of sync.
* Consistency: The property enforces a level of consistency in write operations by requiring acknowledgment from a quorum of in-sync replicas. This prevents scenarios where data is acknowledged as written but is not replicated to a sufficient number of nodes.
* Trade-Off with Performance: While enhancing reliability, setting a higher value for min.insync.replicas can impact write performance, as acknowledgment requires synchronization across multiple replicas.


#### Question:  Discuss Kafka’s support for different message delivery semantics.
**Answer:** : Kafka supports different message delivery semantics to cater to various application requirements. The main delivery semantics include:
* At Most Once (Fire and Forget): In this semantics, producers send messages to Kafka without waiting for acknowledgments. This can result in potential message loss if a failure occurs before the message is replicated.
* At Least Once (Acknowledged Delivery): Producers wait for acknowledgments from Kafka that the message has been written to the log. This ensures that messages are not lost but may result in duplicates if acknowledgment is received by the producer, but the acknowledgment to the client is lost.
* Exactly Once: Kafka's Exactly-Once Semantics, achieved through idempotent and transactional producer configurations, ensures that messages are processed and delivered exactly once, eliminating duplicates and message loss.


#### Question:  What is the role of Kafka's transactional producer API, and how does it differ from the non-transactional API?

* Timestamps: Include timestamps in messages to help consumers order events based on the timestamp, compensating for minor out-of-order delivery.
* Partitioning Strategy: Choose an appropriate partitioning strategy that aligns with the ordering requirements of the data. For example, use a key that ensures related events end up in the same partition.<br>
**Monitoring:**
* Monitor Consumer Lag: Track consumer lag to identify situations where messages are not being consumed in real-time.
* Timestamp Extraction: Leverage timestamp extraction transformations to align messages based on event timestamps.<br>
Dealing with out-of-order messages involves a combination of producer configuration, partitioning strategies, and monitoring to ensure data consistency.


#### Question:  Explain how Kafka handles message deduplication.
**Answer:** : Kafka addresses message deduplication through a combination of producer and broker mechanisms:
* Producer Idempotence: Kafka introduced the concept of idempotent producers. When a producer is configured as idempotent, it ensures that messages are sent exactly once. This helps prevent duplicates caused by retries during transient failures.
* Producer Retries: Producers may encounter failures when attempting to send messages. In non-idempotent scenarios, this could result in duplicate messages. Idempotent producers eliminate duplicates by ensuring that retries do not introduce additional copies of the same message.
* Message Acknowledgments: Producers can configure different levels of acknowledgment from brokers regarding the successful receipt and persistence of messages. Using the acks configuration, producers can specify when a produce request is considered complete. Configuring acks=all ensures acknowledgment from all in-sync replicas, reducing the likelihood of message duplication.
* Broker Log Append Semantics: Kafka brokers follow atomic log append semantics. This means that messages are atomically appended to the log, preventing the same message from being appended more than once, even in the presence of failures.
* Message Ordering: Kafka maintains the order of messages within a partition. While deduplication is not explicitly designed to handle out-of-order delivery, the combination of ordered partitions and idempotent producers contributes to a more deterministic ordering of messages.<br>
By leveraging these mechanisms, Kafka ensures that duplicate messages are minimized, providing reliability and consistency in message delivery.

* Inter-Datacenter Communication: Kafka brokers in different data centers communicate with each other for replication purposes. This requires appropriate network configurations to enable secure and efficient communication.
* Consumer Configuration: Consumers can be configured to read from replicas in the nearest data center, optimizing latency for data access.
* Latency Considerations: Multi-datacenter replication introduces additional latency for data propagation across locations. Organizations need to carefully consider latency requirements based on use cases.
* Handling Data Center Failures: Kafka is designed to handle data center failures gracefully. In the event of a failure, consumers can continue to read from available replicas in other data centers.<br>
Implementing multi-datacenter replication in Kafka requires careful planning, network configuration, and monitoring to ensure data consistency and reliability across distributed environments.


#### Question:  What is the role of the Kafka AdminClient API, and how is it used?
**Answer:** : The Kafka AdminClient API is a Java client that provides administrative functionality to interact with and manage Kafka clusters programmatically. Its role includes:
* Cluster Metadata Retrieval: The AdminClient allows users to retrieve metadata about the Kafka cluster, such as broker information, topic details, and partition assignments.
* Topic and Partition Management: Users can create, delete, and modify topics, as well as manage partitions and replication factors using the AdminClient API.
* Configurations Management: It enables the retrieval and modification of configurations for brokers, topics, and other Kafka entities.
* Partition Reassignment: The AdminClient supports operations for reassigning partitions between brokers, allowing for dynamic cluster reconfiguration.
* Access Control List (ACL) Management: Users can configure and manage access control lists, controlling the security aspects of Kafka.

```
Properties properties = new Properties();
properties.put("bootstrap.servers", "kafka-broker:9092");

try (AdminClient adminClient = AdminClient.create(properties)) {
    // Example: List all topics in the cluster
    ListTopicsResult topicsResult = adminClient.listTopics();
    Set<String> topics = topicsResult.names().get();
    System.out.println("Topics in the cluster: " + topics);
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```


#### Question:  Explain how Kafka handles the scenario of broker failures.
**Answer:** : Kafka is designed to handle broker failures seamlessly, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. Key mechanisms include:
* Replication: Kafka replicates partitions across multiple brokers. Each partition has one leader and multiple followers. If a leader broker fails, one of the followers is promoted to the new leader, ensuring continuous availability.
* In-Sync Replicas (ISR): Only in-sync replicas participate in leader elections. Kafka maintains a set of in-sync replicas for each partition. If a broker falls out of sync, it is excluded from leader election until it catches up.
* Automatic Reassignment: Kafka dynamically reassigns partitions to healthy brokers during broker failures. This process is managed by the Kafka controller, ensuring a balanced distribution of partitions.
* Controller Election: Kafka uses a leader election process to select a controller node responsible for managing the overall state of the cluster. In case of a controller failure, a new controller is elected.
* Broker Monitoring: Kafka continuously monitors the health of brokers. If a broker becomes unresponsive, it is marked as dead, and partition reassignment occurs to maintain availability.
* Quorum Requirements: Kafka ensures that a quorum of replicas is available for each partition to tolerate failures. This quorum allows the system to continue functioning even if some replicas are temporarily unavailable.


#### Question:  Discuss the considerations for choosing the appropriate Kafka storage format (log, compacted log, etc.).
**Answer:** : Choosing the appropriate Kafka storage format involves considering factors such as use case, data retention, and access patterns. Common storage formats include:<br>
**Log Format (Append-Only):**
* Suitable for scenarios where the entire history of events is critical.
* Well-suited for event sourcing architectures.
* Efficient for write-intensive workloads.<br>
**Compacted Log Format:**<br>
* Useful when maintaining the latest state for each key is essential.
* Eliminates duplicate records with the same key, retaining only the latest record.
* Suitable for scenarios like maintaining a changelog or storing configuration information.<br>
**Durable Log Format:**
* Balances between log and compacted log formats.
* Retains the latest record for each key while preserving the entire log.
* Offers a compromise between historical completeness and key-based compaction.
**Time-Windowed Log Format:**
* Segments data based on time, enabling efficient retention and compaction.
* Useful for scenarios where data older than a certain duration is not critical.
* Enables easier management of data retention policies.


#### Question:  How does Kafka address the challenge of maintaining order across multiple partitions?
**Answer:** : Maintaining order across multiple partitions in Kafka is addressed through the following mechanisms:
* Partition Ordering: Within each partition, Kafka maintains the order of records as they are produced. Consumers can rely on the order of records within a partition.
* Producer-Side Partitions Selection: Producers can control the partition to which a record is sent. By assigning a key to a record, producers can ensure that all records with the same key go to the same partition, preserving order for records with the same key.
* Consumer-Side Order Maintenance: Consumers can subscribe to multiple partitions and maintain order by processing records in the order they are received from each partition.
* Global Order via Single Partition: For scenarios where strict global order is crucial, a topic can be configured with a single partition. While this limits parallelism, it ensures a global order for all records.
* Timestamps and Event Time: Kafka records can be timestamped to capture the time of event creation. Consumers can use these timestamps to order records based on event time.
* Log Compaction: For compacted topics, order is maintained by retaining only the latest record for each key. This ensures that the latest state for each key is preserved.<br>
By leveraging these mechanisms, Kafka provides flexibility in maintaining order across multiple partitions based on the specific requirements of the use case.<br>
